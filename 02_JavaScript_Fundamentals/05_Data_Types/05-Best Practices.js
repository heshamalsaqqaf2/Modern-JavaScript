/** 
 * @Best_Practices
 *    1- Be aware of the type of data you're working with. Use typeof if you're unsure.
 *    2- Be cautious with type coercion. Explicit conversion is often clearer and less error-prone.
 *    3- When working with numbers, be aware of potential precision issues with floating-point arithmetic.
 *    4- Use strict equality (===) instead of loose equality (==) to avoid unexpected type coercion.
 * 
 * @summary
 *    1- JavaScript has 7 primitive data types: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, BigInt, and Symbol.
 *    2- Objects are the complex data type in JavaScript.
 *    3- The typeof operator is useful for checking the type of a value.
 *    4- JavaScript is dynamically typed, but understanding types is crucial for writing robust code.
 *    5- Be aware of implicit type coercion in JavaScript - it can be both a convenience and a source of bugs.
 * 
 *  *In the next section, we'll explore type conversions in JavaScript, building on our understanding of data types
