/**
 * @Best_Practices
 *    1- Choose the appropriate loop for your use case.
 *    2- Always ensure your loop has a way to terminate to avoid infinite loops
 *    3- Keep your loops as simple as possible for readability.
 *    4- Use meaningful variable names for your loop counters.
 *    5- Be cautious when modifying loop variables within the loop body.
 *
 * @summary
 *    1- The for loop is used when we know the number of iterations in advance.
 *    2- The while loop continues as long as a condition is true.
 *    3- The do...while loop always executes at least once before checking the condition.
 *    4- The for...of loop provides a simple way to iterate over iterable objects like strings.
 *    5- Be cautious of infinite loops, which can occur when the loop condition is always true.
 *    6- break and continue can be used to control the flow within loops.
 *
 *  *In the next section, we'll explore loops in JavaScript.
