 *       1- The event object and its important properties
 *       2- When and how to prevent default behaviors
 *       3- Event bubbling and when to stop it
 *       4- Working with input values in real-time
 * 
 *   ?Key takeaways:
 *       1- Always log the event object when learning about a new event type
 *       2- Use preventDefault() when you want to handle events your own way
 *       3- Use stopPropagation() sparingly and only when necessary
 *       4- Remember to check event.target.value when working with inputs
 * 
 *   *In the next section, we'll look at common use cases and best practices,
