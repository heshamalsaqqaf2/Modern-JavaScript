/**
 * @Best_Practices
 *    1- Use array literal notation ([]) instead of the Array constructor.
 *    2- Be careful with sparse arrays (arrays with gaps) - they can lead to unexpected behavior.
 *    3- Don't add non-index properties to arrays.
 *    4- Use Array.isArray() to check if something is an array.
 *    5- Remember that arrays are zero-indexed.
 *
 * @summary
 *    1- Arrays are ordered collections of values in JavaScript.
 *    2- Array elements can be of any type.
 *    3- TArray indices start at 0.
 *    4- Arrays are mutable (can be modified).
 *    5- Arrays have a dynamic length property.
 *    6- Arrays are actually special objects with numeric properties and a special length property.
 *
 *  *In the next part, we'll explore basic array methods like push, pop, shift, and unshift,
 *  *which allow us to add and remove elements from arrays programmatically.
