/** 
 * @Best_Practices
 *    1- Use strict equality (===) and inequality (!==) to avoid unexpected type coercion.
 *    2- Be aware of short-circuit evaluation in logical operators.
 *    3- Use parentheses to make the order of operations clear in complex expressions.
 *    4- Be cautious when using increment and decrement operators, especially as part of larger expressions.
 *    5- Use chained assignments sparingly and only when it improves code readability.
 * 
 * @summary
 *    1- Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations and can also be used for string concatenation.
 *    2- Comparison operators compare values and return boolean results.
 *    3- Logical operators perform logical operations and use short-circuit evaluation.
 *    4- Assignment operators can be combined with arithmetic operations for concise code and can be chained.
 *    5- Increment and decrement operators provide a shorthand for adding or subtracting 1.
 *    6- Understanding operator precedence is crucial for writing correct expressions.
 *    7- Understanding how these operators work is crucial for writing effective JavaScript code.
 * 
 *  *In the next section, we'll explore string concatenation and template literals in JavaScript in more detail, building on our understanding of operators and data types
