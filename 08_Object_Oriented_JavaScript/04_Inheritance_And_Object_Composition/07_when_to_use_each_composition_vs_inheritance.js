/** 
 * @summary : When to Use Each (Composition vs Inheritance):
 * 
 *      TODO: Use Inheritance When:
 *          1- There's a clear "is-a" relationship (a Dog is an Animal)
 *          2- The child class is a specialized version of the parent
 *          3- You want to share code between related classes
 *          4- The parent's behavior makes sense for all children
 * 
 *      TODO: Use Composition When:
 *          1- There's a "has-a" relationship (a Car has an Engine)
 *          2- You need more flexibility in combining behaviors
 *          3- Classes need to share some but not all behavior
 *          4- The inheritance hierarchy would get too complex
