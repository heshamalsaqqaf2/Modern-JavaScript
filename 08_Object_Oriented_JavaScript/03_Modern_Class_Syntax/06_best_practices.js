/** 
 * @Best_Practices
 *     1- Always use class names starting with a capital letter
 *     2- Always use 'new' with classes (classes enforce this)
 *     3- Keep classes focused on a single responsibility
 *     4- Use descriptive names for methods
 *     5- Consider using private fields for internal state
 *     6- Return 'this' from methods when it makes sense for chaining
