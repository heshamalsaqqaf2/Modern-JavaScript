/** 
 * @summary
 *     1- Classes provide a cleaner syntax for constructors and prototypes
 *     2- They're not a new system - just a better way to write the old one
 *     3- Classes automatically put methods on the prototype
 *     4- Static methods belong to the class itself
 *     5- Modern features include class properties and private fields
 *     6- Classes enforce 'new' and provide better organization
 * 
 *  * Next, we'll learn about inheritance and how classes make it easier to work with.
