/**  
 * @Best_Practices
 *      Use explicit conversion when you want to be clear about your intentions.
 *      Be aware of implicit conversions to avoid unexpected results.
 *      Use strict equality (===) and strict inequality (!==) to avoid type coercion in comparisons.
 *      When converting to boolean, remember the truthy and falsy rules.
 * @summary
 *      JavaScript provides methods for explicit type conversion: String(), Number(), Boolean().
 *      Each type of conversion follows specific rules, which are important to remember.
 *      Understanding truthy and falsy values is crucial for boolean contexts and conversions.
 *      Implicit type conversion happens automatically in certain contexts, following its own set of rules.
 *      Be cautious with type coercion to avoid unexpected results.
 * 
 *  *In the next section, we'll explore operators in JavaScript, building on our understanding of data types and type conversions.
