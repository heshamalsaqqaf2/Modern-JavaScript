/**

 *     1- Callbacks are functions passed to other functions to be executed later
 *     2- They're used heavily in asynchronous programming
 *     3- We've been using them already (array methods)
 *     4- They can lead to complex nested code ("callback hell")
 *     5- They're still important to understand even though we have better tools now
 * 
 *  * Next, we'll learn about Promises, which provide a more elegant way to handle asynchronous operations.
