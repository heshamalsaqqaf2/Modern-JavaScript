/** 
 * @summary
 *     1- Synchronous code runs in sequence, one line after another
 *     2- Asynchronous code can run in the background while other code continues executing
 *     3- We need asynchronous programming for operations that take time
 *     4- JavaScript uses the Event Loop to handle asynchronous operations
 *     5- Common asynchronous operations include:
 *           1- Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)
 *           2- Server requests
 *           3- File operations
 *           4- User events
 * 
 *     * In the next section, we'll look at how to handle asynchronous operations using,
 *     * callbacks,which are functions that run after an asynchronous operation completes.
