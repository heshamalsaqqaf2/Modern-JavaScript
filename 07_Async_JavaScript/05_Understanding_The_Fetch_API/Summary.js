/** 
 * @summary
 *     1- Fetch API is used for making HTTP requests
 *     2- It returns Promises, so works well with async/await
 *     3- Different types of requests: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
 *     4- Always handle errors properly
 *     5- Check response.ok for HTTP errors
 *     6- Can handle multiple requests with Promise.all
 *     7- Set appropriate headers for different requests
 *     8- Consider loading and error states in real applications
 * 
 *  * Remember: In real applications, you'll often be working with your own API endpoints rather than JSONPlaceholder,
 *      *but the principles remain the same.
