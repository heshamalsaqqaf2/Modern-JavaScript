/** 
 * @description: What is the Fetch API?
 * 
 * The Fetch API provides a way to make HTTP requests to servers from your JavaScript code.
 * It's used to get data from or send data to a server. For example, when you:
 *      1- Load posts on a social media site
 *      2- Submit a form on a website
 *      3- Get weather data from a weather service
 *      4- Send user data to your server
 * 
 * For our examples, we'll use JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), a free fake API service that's perfect for learning.
