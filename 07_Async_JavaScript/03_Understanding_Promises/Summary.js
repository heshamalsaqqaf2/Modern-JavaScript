/** 
 * @summary
 *     1- Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations
 *     2- They can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected
 *     3- Promise chaining solves the callback hell problem
 *     4- Error handling is more straightforward with .catch()
 *     5- Static methods like Promise.all() help manage multiple Promises
 *     6- Proper error handling and Promise chaining are crucial for robust code
 * 
 *  * Next, we'll look at async/await, which makes working with Promises even easier and more readable.
