/** 
 * @summary
 *     1- Async/await is built on top of Promises
 *     2- Makes asynchronous code look synchronous
 *     3- async functions always return Promises
 *     4- Try/catch blocks work for error handling
 *     5- Can handle multiple Promises either sequentially or in parallel
 *     6- Proper error handling is crucial
 *     7- Independent operations should run in parallel
 * 
 *  * Next, we'll look at the Fetch API, where we'll use async/await to make HTTP requests.
