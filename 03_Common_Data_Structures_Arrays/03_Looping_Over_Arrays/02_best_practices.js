/**
 * @Best_Practices
 *    1- Use for...of when you just need to iterate over elements
 *    2- Use traditional for loop when you need the index or more control
 *    3- Cache the array length in very large arrays
 *    4- Be careful when modifying arrays during iteration
 *    5- Consider using array methods (which we'll cover next) instead of loops for transformations
 *
 * @summary
 *    1- Traditional for loops offer the most control
 *    2- while loops can be used but are less common
 *    3- for...of provides a clean syntax for simple iteration
 *    4- Each type of loop has its specific use cases
 *    5- Be aware of common pitfalls like off-by-one errors
 *    6- Consider performance implications with very large arrays
 *
 *  *In the next part, we'll explore array iteration methods like forEach, map, filter, and reduce,
 *  *which provide more declarative ways to work with arrays.
