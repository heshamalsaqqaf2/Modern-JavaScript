/** 
 * @Best_Practices
 *    1- Keep your conditions simple. If a condition is complex, consider breaking it down or using a function.
 *    2- Use the ternary operator for simple conditions, but prefer if...else for more complex logic.
 *    3- Avoid deep nesting of if statements as it can make your code hard to read and maintain.
 *    4- When using multiple ternary operators, consider if an if...else if...else structure would be more readable.
 *    5- Always consider the readability of your code. Sometimes, a slightly longer if...else structure is more clear than a concise but complex ternary operation.
 * 
 * @summary
 *    1- The if statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
 *    2- The if...else statement provides an alternative when the condition is false.
 *    3- The if...else if...else structure allows for multiple conditions.
 *    4- The ternary operator is a shorthand for simple if...else statements and can be chained for more complex conditions.
 *    5- While powerful, complex conditional structures (like chained ternary operators) should be used judiciously to maintain code readability.
