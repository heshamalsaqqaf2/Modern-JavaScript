 * @summary
 *   We've learned:
 *       1- What events are and how they work
 *       2- Different types of events we can listen for
 *       3- How to add and remove event listeners
 *       4- Different ways to write event handling functions
 *       5- The difference between event handlers and event listeners
 * 
 *   *In the next section, we'll explore working with events in practice, 
 *      including the event object and event delegation patterns.
 * 
 *   *Remember: while we've seen many different event types, we'll explore their specific properties
 *      and methods in more detail in the next section. 
 *      The goal here was to understand the fundamentals of how events work and how to handle them.
