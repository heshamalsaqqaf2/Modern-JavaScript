 *     1- Optional chaining (?.) provides safe access to nested properties
 *     2- Nullish coalescing (??) provides better defaults than ||
 *     3- They work great together for handling complex data structures
 *     4- Especially useful for:
 *          - API responses
 *          - Configuration objects
 *          - User input
 *          - Default values
 * 
 *   * Next, we'll look at BigInt for handling large numbers in JavaScript.
