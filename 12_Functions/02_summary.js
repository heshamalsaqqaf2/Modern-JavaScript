/**
 * @summary
 *   Functions are a fundamental building block in JavaScript. 
 *     They allow us to write reusable, organized code. Key points to remember:
 * 
 *          1- Functions can take inputs (parameters) and return outputs.
 *          2- They have their own scope, meaning variables declared inside them are not accessible outside.
 *          3- Use clear, descriptive names for your functions and follow established naming conventions.
 *          4- There are multiple ways to define functions in JavaScript, each with its own use cases.
 *          5- Functions without a return statement or with an empty return implicitly return undefined.
 *
 *  *Practice creating and using functions regularly. 
 *  *They're crucial to becoming proficient in JavaScript and writing efficient, maintainable code.
